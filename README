# tursas

Tursas is a simple chess engine implemented in Clojure.

## Status

- Game REPL: Done except there's no error detection in it
- XBoard interface : Some commands implemented so its playable
- Saving / Loading game: Completed
- Game: Needs testing to detect end-game conditions properly
- State representation: Completed with 0x88 board
- Move generation: Mostly done, promotions need still work
- Search algorithm: Very lightly tested alphabeta
- Evaluator: Material balance and board location scores

The game is somewhat playable via repl. It is very much work
in progress state.
I'm working on ironing out the bugs in the move generation code to get all the basics done.

## Installation

Use leiningen to build the project.
lein uberjar

## Running

After making the jar file you can run the engine with
java -jar tursas-0.1-standalone.jar

## Usage

The game tries to support both UCI and XBoard protocol.  General repl
commands are always available for use.  Once the uci or xboard command
is given the active repl is changed and available command list is
extended to support uci or xboard commands.

Here's the planned command list for 1.0 version:

Available general commands:
  help - display this help
  load - load the last saved game from file
  save - store the current game to file
  bd - display the board on the screen
  fd - display current game state in FEN
  lm - print a list of all available moves
  gs - calculates score for the current game state
  es - evaluates current game state
  pf n - calculate perft score to depth of n
  xboard - ebable xboard mode
  quit - quite the Tursas engine

Available XBoard commands are:
 protover N - change engine to use protocol version N
 accepted - Accept last feature
 reject - Reject last feature
 variant VARIANT - change to use VARIANT rules. Only 'normal' supported
 random - Tell engine to add little random elements
 force - Disable engine AI
 go - Enable engine AI
 sd DEPTH - set search depth to DEPTH
 usermove MOVE - make given MOVE if legal
 ping N - Pings the engine for pong reply
 result RESULT {COMMENTS} - give the game RESULT to engine
 setboard FEN - Set the game board to given FEN.
 hint - prompt move hint from engine
 undo - tell engine to undo last move
 remove - tell engine to undo last two moves
 name X - tell engine its opponents name
 rating - ask engine its rating
 computer - tell engine that its playing against cpu
 option NAME[=VALUE] - tell engine to use new option
