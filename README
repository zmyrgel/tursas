# tursas

Tursas is a chess engine implemented in Clojure. It tries to follow
functional programming style throughout the code.

This is my first project using either Lisp or functional programming
style and this will reflect in the code too.

## Roadmap

These are my aims for the Tursas project.

Version 0.1:
- Subset of Chess Engine Communication Protocol implemented so engine can be played.
- Working alphabeta algorithm
- Game state representation with 0x88 board
- Working evaluator which playes according to rules and can win weakest of players

Possibly added in later versions:
- UCI protocol interface
- Bitboard state representation
- Negascout replacement for alphabeta
- Full Chess Engine Communication Protocol implementation

## Status

- Game REPL: Done except there's isn't error detection in it
- XBoard interface : Small subset of commands implemented
- Saving / Loading game: Completed
- Game: XBoard UI won't detect that game has ended yet
- State representation: Completed with 0x88 board
- Move generation: Done, testing things
- Search algorithm: Simple alphabeta
- Evaluator: Material balance and board location scores

The game is somewhat playable via repl. Currently debugging why XBoard
UI won't cause game to end once mate has been achieved.

## Installation

Use leiningen to build the project.
lein uberjar

## Running

After making the jar file you can run the engine with
java -jar tursas-0.1-standalone.jar
or if using XBoard you can specify the engine via command:
"xboard -fcp 'java -jar tursas-0.1-standalone.jar'"

## Usage

The game tries to support both UCI and XBoard protocol.  General repl
commands are always available for use.  Once the uci or xboard command
is given the active repl is changed and available command list is
extended to support uci or xboard commands.

Here's the planned command list for 1.0 version:

Available general commands:
  help - display this help
  load - load the last saved game from file
  save - store the current game to file
  bd - display the board on the screen
  fd - display current game state in FEN
  lm - print a list of all available moves
  gs - calculates score for the current game state
  es - evaluates current game state
  pf n - calculate perft score to depth of n
  xboard - enable xboard mode
  quit - quite the Tursas engine

Available XBoard commands are:
 protover N - change engine to use protocol version N
 accepted - Accept last feature
 reject - Reject last feature
 variant VARIANT - change to use VARIANT rules. Only 'normal' supported
 random - Tell engine to add little random elements
 force - Disable engine AI
 go - Enable engine AI
 sd DEPTH - set search depth to DEPTH
 usermove MOVE - make given MOVE if legal
 ping N - Pings the engine for pong reply
 result RESULT {COMMENTS} - give the game RESULT to engine
 setboard FEN - Set the game board to given FEN.
 undo - tell engine to undo last move
 remove - tell engine to undo last two moves
 name X - tell engine its opponents name
 rating - ask engine its rating
 computer - tell engine that its playing against cpu
 option NAME[=VALUE] - tell engine to use new option

## Known issues

Currently the game engine will occasionally crash when playing it with
XBoard. AI seems to choose illegal moves occasionally. I have a hunch
that this issue lies in the threaten-by-king function, particulary
when king is threatened by opponents king.
