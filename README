# tursas

Tursas is a simple chess engine implemented in Clojure.

## Status

- UCI / XBoard interface : Some implemented
- Saving / Loading game: done
- REPL to play with: stubbs
- State representation: Done with 0x88 board
- Move generation: Done
- Search algorithm: Functional minimax algorithm implemented
- Evaluator: simple, material balance and board location for now

Currently this is not usable. It is very much work in progress code.
The code compiles and most of the functions seem to work.  Currently
I'm trying to iron out the runtime bugs in the code and try to get it
play with XBoard.

## Installation

Use leiningen to build the project.
lein uberjar

## Running

After making the jar file you can run the engine with
java -jar tursas-0.1-standalone.jar
